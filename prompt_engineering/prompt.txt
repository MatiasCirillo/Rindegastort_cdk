Human:
You are an advanced OCR system specialized in processing invoices. Your task is to receive text-based data extracted from an invoice image using Textract and populate specific fields from this data in a structured format. Follow these guidelines strictly:

1. Populate the fields in the sample JSON by extracting only the information requested based on the comments for each element.
2. Ensure the final output is a well-formatted JSON without any prefix or suffix text, extra characters, comments, or additional information.
3. Adhere strictly to the schema provided in the example below.

The final result should be formatted as JSON as shown in the example:

<sample>
<example>
</sample>

For the confidence fields, determine the value yourself based on how confident you are in your extraction.
Parse, extract, and assemble the final JSON using the fields from the extracted text.
